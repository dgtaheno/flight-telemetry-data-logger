# Overview

Flight Telemetry & Data Logger is a modular ESP32-based flight computer designed for telemetry acquisition, altitude estimation and reliable flight data recording.

The project combines:

- GPS positioning and navigation
- Barometric altitude measurement
- Flight altitude estimation
- CSV data logging
- Runtime health monitoring
- Event-driven diagnostics
- SD card recovery detection
- Buffered telemetry storage
- Automatic buffer flushing
- FIFO-preserved data recovery

All features documented in this repository have been validated on real hardware.

```text
Flight Altitude

=
GPS Reference Altitude
+
BMP388 Relative Altitude
```

```text
Takeoff Altitude : 123.4 m

Climb            : +150.0 m

Flight Altitude  : 273.4 m
```

---

# Flight Logging

## File Naming

When GPS FIX is available:

```text
flight_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv
```

Example:

```text
flight_2026-07-11_23-01-48.csv
```

Fallback:

```text
flight_boot_001.csv
```

---

## CSV Format

```csv
timestamp_s,
temperature_c,
pressure_hpa,
bmp_altitude_m,
gps_fix,
